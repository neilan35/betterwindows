                        <p>If you’re looking for a window or door that facilitates ventilation for your space, you should consider the tilt and slide. With its tilt-in option, you can conveniently control the air ventilation that is entering and leaving the room.</p>

                        <p>Often called the ‘airplane door’ due to its parallel sliding feature, these tilt slide windows and doors are able to tilt in at the top of the window and slide left or right, allowing you to create an opening up to 1650 mm wide.</p>

                    </br></br>

                        <h4>The perfect application for large openings</h4>

                        <p>The good thing about tilt and slide windows and doors is that they come in three standard configurations, but can easily be custom made to fit the overall width, height and length of the openings you’d like it install on.</p>
                        
                        <p>You can also be confident of the security of tilt slide windows and doors, as when they are locked in the tilt in position, the product will be completely secured. It’s also very easy to operate this system as the same lever controls the sliding, tilting and locking function of the door or window.</p>
