                        <p>Also known as Folding Windows and Doors, Bifold Windows and Doors are simply windows and doors that can fold in or out to open up a space in a desired location. Bifold Doors are mostly used on exterior applications, where the doors open to connect the inside to the outside.</p>

                        <p>Using only original German components and hardware, both interior and exterior Bifold Windows and Doors offer amazing flexibility in design and are remarkably easy to operate, with a simple tracking system running along the panels. </p>

                        <p>Panels are usually connected together in a train and can be joined together in a number of configurations. Bifold Doors are designed to come in pairs, with two doors folding to one side, or with four doors that split in the centre and have two doors folding back to each side, and so on. Bifold Doors can usually be manufactured to provide an even or odd number of doors (sometimes referred to as MultiFold Doors). </p>
